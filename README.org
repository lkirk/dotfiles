#+TITLE: config, dotfiles, and boostrapping

this repo contains a unified set of dotfiles it will install 
itself with a simple set of symlinks. To perform this action:
#+begin_src sh
make install
#+end_src

there is also a complete system bootstrapping script to create
an entire custom arch system, all the way from partitioning the
drive to configuration settings. this repo ultimately gets
pulled and installed into the new system. this can be invoked by:
#+begin_src sh
make bootstrap-system DISK=/dev/to/be/destroyed USER=username
#+end_src
